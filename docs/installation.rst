Stable release
--------------

To install WTDpy, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Use pip to install wtdpy
    pip install wtdpy

This is the preferred method to install WTDpy, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you do not have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
